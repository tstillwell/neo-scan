# neo-scan

Connects to NASA NEOWS API and displays info about nearby 
Near Earth Objects in the browser.

The code which fetches the data from the API
is in js/main.js

Please get an API key and add it in if you'll be
running more than a few queries. 

In main.js


`'api_key' : 'DEMO_KEY'`

Replace DEMO_KEY with your actual API key or your
requests will be automatically rate-limited.
