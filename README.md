# NEO Scan

Connects to NASA NEOWS API and displays  approximate distance
and estimated size info about nearby Near Earth Objects in the browser.

## NASA NEOWS API
The code which fetches the data from the API
is in js/main.js

This API is documented here:

https://api.nasa.gov/#getting-started

To run the app, open `index.html` in your browser

#### Get an API key
If you want to use the app past a few queries,
you will need to get a free API key from NASA

Sign up for a NASA API key here

https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key

To change the API key open
`js/main.js` and look for the line near
the top that has:


`'api_key' : 'DEMO_KEY'`

Replace DEMO_KEY with your actual API key or your
requests will be automatically rate-limited.
